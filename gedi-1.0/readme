This is a little bit of help on how to tag and build GeDI now that it is in
SourceForge's subversion.  So, let's see what we can do:

--TAGGING--
This takes a few manual steps at the moment.  So, here goes:

0) Edit the META file to update the version/revisions as needed and commit
1) Create the tag with the create_tag script:

./create_tag

--CREATING RPMS--
This should be pretty simple.  I recommend doing this from the actual tag
directories because you're more likely to have a versioned RPM that actually
matches the tag you used.  Once you think you know where you want to be, just
type:

make rpm

Or, if you'd like a specific tag you can do:

make rpm tag=<TAG>

Or, if you'd like to make an rpm of the current trunk:

make rpm tag=HEAD
